		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>MiniWeb is a mini HTTP server implementation written in C language, featuring 
			low system resource consumption, high efficiency, good flexibility and high 
			portability. It is capable to serve multiple clients with a single thread, 
			supporting GET and POST methods, authentication, dynamic contents (dynamic web 
			page and page variable substitution) and file uploading. MiniWeb runs on POSIX 
			complaint OS, like Linux, as well as Microsoft Windows (Cygwin, MinGW and 
			native build with Visual Studio). The binary size of MiniWeb can be as small as 
			20KB (on x86 Linux). The target of the project is to provide a functional HTTP 
			server that is embeddable in other applications (as a static or dynamic 
			library) as well as a standalone web server.</p>
